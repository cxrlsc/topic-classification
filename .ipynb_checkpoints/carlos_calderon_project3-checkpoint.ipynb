    "In this project, you'll work with text data from newsgroup posts on a variety of topics. You'll train classifiers to distinguish posts by topics inferred from the text. Whereas with digit classification, where each input is relatively **dense** (represented as a 28x28 matrix of pixels, many of which are non-zero), here each document is relatively **sparse** (represented as a **bag-of-words**). Only a few words of the total vocabulary are active in any given document. The assumption is that a label depends only on the count of words, not their order.\n",

    "ANSWER: The KNN model is not a good choice for this problem given the relatively sparse dataset and the model's high sensitivity to outliers. These two result in the model's poor performance. The strong independence assumptions in NB models account for better performance relative to Logistic Regression models. In Logistic Regression, lower values of C result in higher penalties for large coefficients, as a result, low values of C result in a low squared sum of the weights and higher values of C correspond to higher weights.

    "ANSWER: I found it strange that the bigrams `you are` and `are you` display significantly different weights for different topics. For the space topic, `you are` has a weight of $\\approx0.03$ whilst `are you` has a negative weight of $\\approx-0.3$. With this being said, there are significantly more stop word bigrams than I thought there would be. This is surprising to me because stop words are usually removed when preprocessing textual data, and seeing them here with high valued weights is conterintuitive to that process. Realistically, these stop words should have similar weights accross all topics. "

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of regularization is to avoid learning very large weights (which are likely to fit the training data, but not generalize well) by adding a penalty to the total size of the learned weights. Logistic regression seeks the set of weights that minimizes errors in the training data AND has a small total size. The default L2 regularization computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (as in Part 3 above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. Whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, **L1 regularization drives many of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features**. For this reason, we can use it as a way to do \"feature selection\".\n",

    "1. How does performance of the models based on reduced vocabularies compare to that of a model based on the full vocabulary?\n",

    "* You can use `LogisticRegression(..., tol=0.015)` to produce a logistic regression model using relaxed gradient descent convergence criteria.  The gradient descent code that trains the logistic regression model sometimes has trouble converging with extreme settings of the C parameter.

    "ANSWER: What we see here is that as the logged vocabulary size increases, the f1 score increases with it. However, at a log vocabulary size of around 5, this upwards trend dissapears and what we have instead is a f1 score that is spiking at around 6.5 log vocabulary size, then decreasing, and then rising again near a log vocabulary size of 7."

    "ANSWER: `CountVectorizer` simply computes the count for each word in the dataset. This results in rarely used words being weighted less although they might be important in the overall model generation. `TfidfVectorizer` addresses this by inversely weighting the frequency of words in one entry by that word's appearance in the whole document. In turn, rare words are given higher weights with the `TfidfVectorizer` than with the `CountVectorizer`. Looking at the top 3 documents in terms of R-ratio, we can see that the vectorizer is not sensitive to emptry strings. We can remove these from the overall training data. "
